# CodeLathe-Test


This repository stores the app I have built in line with CodeLathe's test, all requirements have been fulfilled along with some additional extras I added for fun.


## The Requirements

#### Public API

I have integrated into the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search) to enable fetching of gifs that are currently trending, alongside to providing the capability to search for gifs with a particular search term.

The search bar works best on a real device due to animating alongside the keyboard. If not possible, I would recommend enabling the software keyboard when using it to see how the search bar animates when using the search functionality.

In addition, a message is shown if no gifs are found and the table view is empty.

#### Virtual CV

I have matched the design specified exactly on the Virtual CV screen. (https://www.figma.com/file/HBk47Lh9jTB25NPNOYSdoQ/CodeLathe-Technical-Test
